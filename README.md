# 🛡️ CybersecurityofMerdo

CybersecurityofMerdo is my personal learning and demo website, created to explore the world of full-stack web development, cybersecurity, and digital creativity.

The main goal of this project is to share knowledge, experiment with design and functionality, and combine education, interactivity, and entertainment.
Over time, I plan to expand it with interactive security games, AI-based tools, and back-end services that demonstrate real-world cybersecurity and data-handling concepts.

# 🚀 Features

Responsive front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Animated scroll effects using ScrollReveal.js

Secure contact form powered by EmailJS

Custom pages: Impressum, Privacy Policy, Contact, Audio Player

Back-end integration (Node.js + Express) for form handling and data processing

Focus on security-aware coding and clean structure

# 🧠 Purpose

This project is not only about web design, it’s a personal journey into cybersecurity, front-end logic, and back-end architecture.
It serves as both a portfolio and an educational playground, connecting creativity with technical depth.
As a full-stack developer, I work on:

the front-end → user experience, design, interactivity

the back-end → secure data handling, API development, and logic control
